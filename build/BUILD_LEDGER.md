# BLUME Build Ledger v1
**Status:** Canonical implementation roadmap · created June 19, 2026
**Authority:** Doctrine locked (`docs/doctrine/blume-q1-q2-q3-resolution.md`); build gate OPEN.
**Purpose:** Let BLUME be resumed by *any* future Claude session after *any* gap, with near-zero context loss.

> ## ⏩ HOW TO RESUME (read this first, every session)
> 1. Read **`build/CURRENT_STATE.md`** — where we are (wave, last done, in-progress, blocked).
> 2. Read **`build/NEXT_ACTION.md`** — the single next task to execute.
> 3. Skim **`build/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the locked invariants you must not violate.
> 4. Pick up the task by its **BLUME-### ID** from the Master Task Table below. Do one task per focused session.
> 5. On finish: append to **`build/COMPLETED.md`**, update `CURRENT_STATE.md` + `NEXT_ACTION.md`, set task status here to `DONE`.
> **You never need to reread the whole project.** "Resume from BLUME-047" must Just Work.

## 1. Architecture Invariants (do not violate — full detail in ARCHITECTURE.md / doctrine)
- **Constitutional Layer:** Vaults = *what happened* · Lotus = *how healthy* · BLUME = *what next* · Terravian-MCP = *where to go*. BLUME reads every vault, **owns none**.
- **Structural Principle:** `Owner → Holding → Brand → Artifact`. Vaults are **category lenses**, not ownership entities, not top-level.
- **Router-tag contract** (the BLUME-MCP ↔ Terravian-MCP interface): `{ uuid, brand, vault, switch, title, timestamp, version, source, hash, metadata }`.
- **MCP boundary:** BLUME-MCP owns taxonomy + router-tag + **Lotus (all scoring/readiness)** + sales switches + intelligence. Terravian-MCP owns cross-brand routing + ownership/permission (SlateRiver root → future TFT/TDT).
- **Open architectural calls (do not pre-decide):** vault representation physical-vs-logical (lean: artifacts-first / views); Compliance vault under review (reeval Sep–Dec 2026).

## ⚠️ RE-BASELINE (2026-06-19) — BLUME is ALREADY BUILT, not greenfield
This ledger was first drafted assuming a blank slate. **Coverage audit (`COVERAGE_REPORT_v1.md`) proved otherwise:** two working MCP servers exist — **`blume/` = BLUME-MCP** (generation, 8 CORE vaults, 26 brands, search, festivals) and **`terravian-mcp/` = Terravian-MCP** (BLUME adapter, social gateway, scheduler+daemon, events, queue, workflows, observability, approvals). The doctrine's BLUME-MCP↔Terravian-MCP split is **real and mid-migration** (`terravian-mcp/src/adapters/blume.ts` → `@terravian/blume`).
**So `BLUME-001` (scaffold server) is OBSOLETE.** True Wave-1 order: **BLUME-004 (reconcile) → BLUME-005 (voice cleanup) → S4 Lotus (040–043, the real missing keystone) → S1/S2 artifact+router-tag spine → BLUME-032 (8→12 vaults).** Lotus + the artifact/router-tag spine are the genuine gaps; most "infra" is built (S20–S27).

---

## 3. MVP Spine (Wave 1) — the smallest functioning BLUME
**The loop:** one brand → **ingest** artifact → **assign router-tag metadata** → **assign vault/category** → **store** → **Lotus score** → **readiness output**. Nothing else.
**Spine tasks (⭐):** BLUME-001, 002, 003, 010, 011, 020, 021, 030, 031, 040, 041, 042, 043.
**Critical path:** 001 → 002 → 003 → 010 → 011 → 021 → 031 → 041 → 042 → 043 (gated by 020, 030, 040).
**Spine done-criteria:** a single tool call `readiness(brand)` returns a Launch Readiness % + band, computed from artifacts ingested through the tagged/categorized/stored pipeline.

---

## 4. Build Waves
- **Wave 1 — Spine:** the MVP loop above.
- **Wave 2 — Visibility:** vault views, Health Bar, missing-evidence/bottleneck, search, readiness surface, investor summary.
- **Wave 3 — Reliability:** audit log, un-backdatable timestamps, versioning, idempotency, validation, tests, backup.
- **Wave 4 — Intelligence:** recommendation engine, sales switches, memory, library.
- **Wave 5 — Scale:** multi-brand, Terravian-MCP routing + permission, identity, publishing, investor full, performance.
Every task belongs to **exactly one** wave.

## 6. Dependency Notes & Critical Path
- **Critical path to first value (Wave 1):** `001 → 002 → 003 → {010→011, 020→021}, {030}, {040} → 031 → 041 → 042 → 043`.
- **Wave 2** depends on `031` (categorization) and `041/043` (scores) existing.
- **Wave 4 Recommendation (080)** is the first "BLUME answers what next" — depends on Wave 2 detection (053,054).
- **Wave 5 Terravian-MCP (130+)** is the *only* place ownership/permission lives — never bleed it into BLUME-MCP.
- **External dependency:** Publishing (150) is gated on the StealthAPI `.from()` repoint to `sapi_*` (see memory `project_terravian_publishing_pipeline`).

---

## 7. Continuity Protocol
**Task lifecycle:** `TODO → WIP → DONE` (or `BLOCKED`/`PARKED`). One task = one focused session.
**On completion, ALWAYS:**
1. Set the task row Status → `DONE` here.
2. Append a line to `build/COMPLETED.md`: `BLUME-### · <date> · <commit-sha> · <one-line result>`.
3. Update `build/CURRENT_STATE.md` (last-done, in-progress, blocked) and `build/NEXT_ACTION.md` (the next single task).
4. If a decision was made, append an ADR to `build/DECISIONS.md`.

**Standard handoff block** (paste into CURRENT_STATE.md and/or session end):
```
## HANDOFF — <date>
Current State : Wave <n>, working BLUME-<id>
Completed     : up to BLUME-<id> (see COMPLETED.md)
Blocked       : <BLUME-id + reason, or none>
Next Task     : BLUME-<id> — <one line>
Known Risks   : <bullets, or none>
```

**Success criterion:** a future Claude session, after months away, reads CURRENT_STATE → NEXT_ACTION → does the next task — with near-zero context loss.

## 8. Persistence Files (always exist, in `build/`)
| File | Purpose | Cadence |
|------|---------|---------|
| `BUILD_LEDGER.md` | This file — canonical roadmap, all tasks, waves, deps | Update task status as work lands |
| `CURRENT_STATE.md` | Living snapshot: wave, last-done, WIP, blocked | Every session |
| `NEXT_ACTION.md` | The single next task to execute | Every session |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Locked invariants (constitutional layer, taxonomy, MCP boundary, stack, open Qs) | Rarely (on architecture change) |
| `DECISIONS.md` | ADR log — append-only design decisions (ADR-000 = doctrine lock) | On each decision |
| `COMPLETED.md` | Append-only done log (id · date · commit · result) | On each task done |
